1. Given the values table below, what data types do each of these values represent?

A Clockwork Orange - String
42 - Integer
09/02/1945 - Object (Or just a string)
98.7 - Float
15.99 - Float

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

If the data needs to be carried onto multiple machines, not just at one location/user, 
then a database should be used. If the program is only used locally on one machine, then a
 text file should be fine.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is almost like english, kind of human readable. Other languages are harder to understand. 
SQL doesn't provide instructions to create/deploy things, but rather is used to retrieve information.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

The user will interact with a GUI, made with React. The react use SQL to manipulate a database that 
will store information that the user needs.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Table - the whole table that contains a matrix of information about something in particular.
Row - a row of the table that contains all the attributes associated with a particular entry
Column - an attribute that an entry may have.
Value - the actual value of an attribute belonging to a certain entry

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

String - store standard information such as name, address...
Object - store more complex information like user profiles or whatever is needed
Integer - store basic numbers, can be an attribute of something.

7. Given the payments table below, provide a description in english and the results of the following queries:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;
     
     // Will return a table with the columns date and amount. In this case, all 4 rows would be returned

     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;
     
     // Will return a table with just one column, amount, whose value is over 500
     // In this case, just the first amount will be displayed: 1500

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = "Mega Foods";
     
     // Will return a table with all the existing columns and rows where the payee is Mega Foods
     // In this case only one row will be in the table, with all columns there.
     
   
8. Given the users table below, write the following SQL queries and their results:

Select the email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
	
	SELECT email, signup
	FROM users
	WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';


Select the user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

	SELECT userid
	FROM users
	WHERE email= 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';


Select all the columns for the user ID equal to 4.  

	SELECT *
	FROM users
	WheRE userid = 4;
